[Sulu](http://sulu.io/) is an open-source content management platform based on the
[Symfony PHP framework](http://cmf.symfony.com/). Use it as a CMS to develop and
manage enterprise multi-sites or as a development environment to create reliable
and high-performant web-apps.

We use [Browserstack](https://www.browserstack.com/) for cross browser testing.

**Although Sulu is stable and already used in production it is still under
heavy development. Therefore we can not guarantee full backwards compatibility
at the current stage.**
